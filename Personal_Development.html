		<th> REFLECTION </th>
            <td align="left" style="font-size:20px;" > The Twelve Pillar provides principles aimed toward self development and success. Through Chapters 4 to 7 Rohn and C.Widener 	highlighted some key point that are vital throughout our lives. In chapter 4 they provided insight on why it is important to not only have goal but to write 	them down as well. Writing down your goal will push and motivate you to think of and create said goals. Writing down your goals will give you a better chance 	of achieving them. When your goals are just in your head swirling around you're likely to just forget some if not most or all of them, writing it down allows 	your to have something physical that  you can look at ever so often to remind yourself of what you need to accomplish. <br> Chapter 5 went on to speak about 	how people utilize their time, time is not just referencing now or today but how they spend their lives in general. People become so obsessed with 	responsibilities and bills that they forget that they are on borrowed time and they need to live a little. This reminded me that university is not just about 	education it is about the experience as a whole, which make taking parkin extra curricular activities and not just going to and leaving classes.<br> Chapter 6 	speaks to being mindful of who you surround yourself. Your friends are reflection of who you are. The people that you surround yourself with should always have 	a positive impact on your life, they should push you to become the best you. This reminded me to ask my self how are they impacting me and my life. This forces 	me to reflect on my life experience with them. Lastly Chapter 7 speak to constantly improving ourselves, gaining new knowledge. It highlights self education, 	education does not end when we leave university. we have to be eager to learn more to develop with society and learn new thing. It made me realize that people 	become stagnant after they leave any type of learning institute they do not pursue self education, this chapter helped me to realize that I don't want that to 	be me.  </td>
