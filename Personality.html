	<td align="left" style="font-size:20px;">  
			I believe my persistence is one of my best and strongest quality, this quality has brought me this far in my 	academic life. 
			It forces me to maintain my drive to acomplish what I want; as well as pushing me to work twice as hard when faced with a difficult module.
			Additonally my ability to manage my emotions  has been a massive help when it comes to networking and engaing with people especially as a 			resident student. I am able to meet and befriend people from different faculties that I would have otherwise nerver met.    </td>

	<tr>  <th align="left">  Favorite Quote  </th> 
	<td style="font-size:20px;"> My favorite quote is "Believe in yourself and you are half way there" by Theodore Roosevelt. This quote thought me to belive in my 	self, no matter how impossible something may seem if you have faith and believe that you can achieve something you will work twice as hard in order to 	achieve 	said goal. Sometime when school start to become too much to handle I just have to believe in my self and remember to have faith.Have faith that i can do this; 	that this is achievable and with the quint of an eye it will be just a distant memory.</td>

	<tr> <th align="left">  Personality Test and Reflection  </th> 
	<td align="left" style="font-size:20px;">  
		Doing this personality test cemented some things that I already new; while at the same time highlighting some stuff. The personlaity type that it 	reported was a logician, it helped me to put a few thing into perspective. My personality trait of being 78% introverted did not suprise me as i have always 	considered my self to be more on the introverted side. I like to interact and get to know people but at the same time I like to be in my own company even more. 	Based on the reports from the site <a href="https://www.16personalities.com" target="_self"> 16personalities.com </a> I would say the site is mostly 	valid, 	I agree with most of the result but some of it I think is a bit off. </td>
